mefiModernRetro
===============

Retro styling for the new MefiModern theme

• Tested on (and geared towards) dark mode on the blue only.
• Works well for me on current Chrome, OSX, using the Stylish extension.
• I got rid of the secondary nav (Home, FAQ, About, etc) cuz I never click that stuff. It's the first line of the css, though, so you can remove that rule and you'll get it back. 
• I got rid of the css color transitions also cuz they drive me a bit crazy on hover. If you are a fan of transitions that's the last rule in the css.
