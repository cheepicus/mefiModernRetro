mefiModernRetro
===============

Retro styling for the new MefiModern theme

- Tested on (and geared towards) dark mode on the blue only.
- Works well for me on current Chrome, OSX, using the Stylish extension.
- I'm using a high-res Macbook Pro screen, so the size might be too big for some folks. Try it out and see. I usually browse MeFi w/ some level of zoom so this works good for me. If it is too big, try zooming out. If that's a no-go, I (or someone else) can redo the stylesheet w/ smaller text sizes and us big screen folk can use zoom as usual.
- I got rid of the secondary nav (Home, FAQ, About, etc) cuz I never click that stuff. It's the first line of the css, though, so you can remove that rule and you'll get it back. 
- I got rid of the css color transitions also cuz they drive me a bit crazy on hover. If you are a fan of transitions that's the last rule in the css.
